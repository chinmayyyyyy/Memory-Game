## üéÆ Game Instructions

### Objective
The goal of the game is to match all pairs of cards with the least number of tries and in the shortest time possible. You'll need to flip two cards at a time and try to find matching pairs.

---

### Gameplay

1. **Start the Game**:
   - Choose your preferred **difficulty** and **theme**.
   - Click the **Restart** button to reset the game.

2. **Flipping Cards**:
   - Click on any card to flip it over.
   - You can only flip two cards at a time. After two cards are flipped, the game will check if they match.

3. **Matching Cards**:
   - If the two flipped cards match (i.e., they have the same symbol), they will remain face up.
   - If they don't match, both cards will be flipped back face down after a short delay.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - You win the game once all the pairs of cards are matched.
   - A celebratory confetti effect will appear, and a sound will play to celebrate your victory.
